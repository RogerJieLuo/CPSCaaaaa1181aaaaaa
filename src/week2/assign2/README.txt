This is a submission for CPSC 1181 - 001 assignment 2
Includes Instrument.java and InstrumentTest.java.

The Instrument has type, brand name, model, mrsp, item id, markup and discount attributes.
Users can create instrument object by
    new Instrument()
or
    new Instrument(String type, String brandName, String modelNumber, double mrsp) 
If the type of instrument is null or empty, system will set type to "!none" as default. The item id is generated by
system with first character of type and number start from 100. For example, first piano's item id is "p100", the
second piano is "p102", next flute is "f103" etc.

The InstrumentTester includes several static test cases. When you run this java file, you can find the output in the
terminal. The outputs are separated by "********" line and compare the expected results with actual results.
