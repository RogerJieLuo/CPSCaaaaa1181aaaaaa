Game: Black-White

Description:
    Black-White is a board game with 10 x 10 board for two players.
    Game starts with 2 black and 2 white stones at the center and same color is not next
    to each other. Players take turn to play. When the stone is played on the board, any opponent's stone that
    is in straight line and between the new played stone and closest another current player's stone will be changed
    to the current user's color.
    Each movement players make must be valid which is able to change at least one of opponent's stone color.
    After all the cell in the board is filled, or there is no more valid movement, then game stops and start
    counting. The player with more stone wins. If two players have the same amount of stones, it's a tie. If one player
    resigns, another player wins.
    one room can contains many players, but only the first 2 players are playing on the board, others will be the
    attendant and view only.
