add components to containers
use layout manager to place the components
JFrame uses Flow layout by default (fill the right space then flow down)

component default is 0 x 0, need to put setPreferredSize() in the components class

swingset


class 2
user interface:
    design: what do you want to display, layout, group
    action on the button

lambda
    if the java interface has exactly one abstract method (like ActionLisener, Comparable, Runnable), then it's called
    functionalInterface because it does one function.
    Lambda expression defines "the parameters and return value of a method in a compact notation"
    so we say lambda expression can be used to specify the one single abstract function of the java interface
    a lambda expression must be assigned to a functional interface variable.

    example

1) In a class that implements the functional interface, the single abstract method is defined by the lambda expression.
2) an object of that class is created( the object is actually created)
3) the reference of that created object is assigned to the variable

general syntax:
    (type paramA, type paramB) -> expression
    (type paramA, type paramB) -> {statements; }
    the data type could be inferred by the compiler
        e -> { statements;}

    ArguementList -> statements body
    (int x, int y) -> x + y;
    () -> 2018
    (string s) -> { sout(s);}



Exception when implement Interface
    override method can not throw exception if it doesn't throw in the parent class
    if parent doesn't throw exception, the child can not throw exception,( method() throws exception). Child can handle
        exception inside, but not throw out.
    if parent does throw exception, child may or may not throw exception.
